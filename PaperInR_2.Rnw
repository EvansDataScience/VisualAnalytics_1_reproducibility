\begin{abstract}
This is an example on how to make a reproducible paper. We are using R from Rstudio, creating an RSweave document. This is a nice start to create a nice paper and get an A+. The next sections will show the steps taken.

This is my intro to my great paper, I will explain the cool things I can do with my new `computational thinking' powers combined with some Latex.

\section{Exploring Data}\label{explo}

% footnotes, italic with \emph and referencing:
Sections may use a label\footnote{In fact, you can have a label wherever you think a future reference to that content might be needed.}. This label is needed for referencing. For example the next section has label \emph{datas}, so you can reference it by writing: As we see in section \ref{catexplo}.
